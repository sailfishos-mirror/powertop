### Derived class nhm_cpu, nhm_core, nhm_package, atom_core, etc.
Architecture-specific implementations (e.g., Nehalem, Atom) that handle specific MSRs and power features.


## class tunable

Base class for power-saving settings that can be "tuned" (e.g., SATA link power management).

### Key public methods
* `good_bad()`: Returns whether the current setting is optimal for power saving.
* `toggle()`: Switches between "good" and "bad" settings.
* `description()`: Returns a std::string description of the tunable setting.
